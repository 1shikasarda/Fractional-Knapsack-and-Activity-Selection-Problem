# Fractional-Knapsack-Problem
1. Problem: Consider a scenario where a student has limited
time to study for exams and wants to maximize the total
score achieved in a set amount of time. Each topic
represents an item with a certain study time and
corresponding value (score). The Fractional Knapsack
Problem can be applied to help the student strategically
allocate their study time to maximize the overall score within
the available time frame. Implement the solution for this
problem.

#Activity-Selection-Problem
2. Problem: Consider a scenario where a conference organizer
wants to schedule multiple talks within a limited time frame,
with each talk having a start and end time. The organizer
aims to maximize the number of talks without overlapping.
The greedy approach can be applied to efficiently select the
talks and create an optimal schedule. Implement the
solution for this problem.
